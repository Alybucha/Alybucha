    <p>This semester will be the start of my of my third year at the University of New Mexico. I am majoring in Multimedia Journalism. With my family owning a sign shop, I was able to gain some background knowledge about graphic designing. So when I came to UNM I wanted to focus on car graphic designing. I thought I would like to one day own my own graphic design company that focuses on car graphics.</p>
    <p>Since attending my Fall 2022 semester at UNM I have realized I have grown a passion for Investigative Journalism. Each time I am approached with an assignment I always liked to find the mystery stories that took a little extra thinking. I appreciate the knowledge I have learned this semester as it has really made me evaluate what I would like to do long term. </p>

    <p>I also wanted to present my WordPress Blog that is still a work in progress. Although I am pleased with the information I have posted. There definitely will be much more to come. The idea I had for this blog was more of a tips and tricks guide to making women&rsquo;s lives easier. Since then I have altered my theme a bit and am still a bit unsure where I am going with it. I hope that if you have any ideas or want to comment on anything I can improve on, to just contact me at the email provided on my contact&rsquo;s page. Thank you!</p>
