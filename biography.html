    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>Welcome! To my website

Hello, my name is Alyssa. This will be my 3rd year at UNM, majoring in Multimedia Journalism. With my family owning a sign shop I was able to gain some background knowledge about graphic designing, so when I came to UNM I wanted to focus on designing. I would like to one day own my own graphic design company that focuses on car graphics. Outside of school, I like to go on hikes and take my dogs with me almost everywhere I go. Gemma (multi-color) is always hyper and ready to go. Bailey (white/black) is more mellow but they're both the best dogs ever. I am excited to be interacting with you all and hope we have a smooth semester.</p>
	  
<p>I felt I have come a long way as far as creating this website along with other in my current class. There is still a long way for me to go as a writer. I hope to become more involved with my local news community and obtain an internship with KOAT 7 or KOB 4 News. I have become more interested in broadcast and investigative journalism. There are always major newsworthy storyâ€™s to be reported on and receive public awareness. I want to be able to provide that to my audience.</p>
