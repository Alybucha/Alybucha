    <p>Hello and welcome to my website. This is a site I have created myself with the knowledge I have gained this semester in my COMM-2245 Web Design course. I took this course at the University of New Mexico in hopes that it would better my website building skills.</p>
    <p>Since taking this class I was able to go from learning little to nothing about computer software&rsquo;s to happily saying that I am a proficient beginner slowly moving to intermediate web designing stages. At this point I hope to continue growing my knowledge as well as my skills as a web designer. I have put a lot of effort into this website and would like to share some of the work I have completed this semester with you all. </p>
<p>There are things I am still improving and trying to better as a student, friend, women in our society so every day is a challenge when attempting to create something of myself with the number of resources I am allocated. I always knew I wanted to make others around me feel better wither it be their day, about themselves, or even about someone else. By creating this website I want to show case some of my favorite assignment as well as the structure and skills I have learned creating this website. </p>
<p>I hope that you enjoy the website I have created and appreciate the work I have accomplished this semseter.</p>
