	<p> This peice I wanted to present to you all was an article a wrote about what I would like to do better on my blog based on another blog I had looked at.</p>
	
    <p>Everyday I wake up and I tell myself, today is going to be better than yesterday because I truly believe that. I believe we all learn new skills or gain some sort of new knowledge when we step out of our houses into society. So in honor of learning something new I wanted to start off by analyzing some similar sites as to mine and what I hope to improve mine to be.</p>

	<p>This is a Blog called The Every Girl. From a first glance I love the design and set up of this sight. It has easily accessible tabs for different topics of discussion. Similar to how I would like to set up my site. There is a section to the right that features new articles which is a great way to draw new traffic into the site.</p>

<p>As I reviewed the blog and followed through some of the pages I have a better understanding of a blog setup and what helps traffic and functions within the site. The Every Girl has many posts and traffic throughout its page through links of Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest which greatly benefits the author. I want to make mine as easily accessible to my audience. As of right now my audience is limited to family, friends, and peers but I hope to gain knowledge through my work to continue with my site. Eventually I would like to promote my site once I get more posts and information onto the platform.</p>

<p> I wanted to evaluate the Home and Living page of this site because it is most related to what I would like to promote onto my own site. I can see how having a subgroup of articles could be helpful to the use but I would like to have my articles in an order of relevance as well as newest on top and oldest on the bottom. On this site there are many topics of discussion. Many people can visit and relate to this site because of the wide variety of content. As for my site I would prefer to focus on about 5 topics at most. Lifestyle improvement, health and wellness, crafts, home decor and cooking. There are many layouts to play with when setting up a website. Overall, I think this site has room for improvement but I love the design setup, and the unique features of pages it has for its audience. I hope to incorporate some ideas when building my site.
